                Hello. My name is Sikander. I am a beginner web developer, currently doing a bootcamp course with University of Birmingham. In my spare time, I usually like to cook/bake stuff and sometimes get to drawing things. Soon I want to start learning the piano as it has been my fascination for a quite a while and seems a very interesting thing to learn. Thanks for your time!

                This is my first project since I started my course with UOB Bootcamp. Just a few clicks and words will give you plentiful information about your choice of food and drink. Below are the relevant links for this project.

            <p>
                This is an application that helps you keep track of your workday, I.E. a workday scheduler. You can save, add and delete entries for the working hours of a day as you wish. The text area changes colour depending on the time of the day as well. Below are the relevant links for this project.

            <p>
                Do you know the basics of JavaScript? Are you SURE you know the basics of JavaScript? Why not take this test and try to set the highest score you can? Every wrong answer cuts off some points and time from your test :)<p>(For legal reasons anyone can answer these questions I am just joking.)</p>
